# L3n
Introducing **l3n**, the Future of Software Delivery

## Manifesto
We believe that quality assurance leads to bugs and stifles output. By simply advocating all functionality as feature, we can exponentially increase productivity and potential quality.

**L3n** observes: `Scope - Quality = Velocity`

## The 12 Pillars of **L3n**
*We follow these principles:*

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. **L3n** processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* **L3n** processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances velocity.

* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behaviour accordingly.

## Branding:
**L3n** is an abbreviation of **Leeen**.
 Using a [TLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym) embodies the spirit of **l3n** and has multiple benefits:
* Best practice
* Credibility
* 40% efficiency

## Provenance:
**L3n** is the spiritual successor of **2lean**, which in turn is the spiritual successor of Lean Agile.

**2lean** observes: `Scope - Velocity = Quality`.

After years of practical application, **2lean** was shown to deliver unrivalled levels of Potential Velocity. Unfortunately it was also proven to be a massive waste of time.
